# apeia.eu — Project Brief
Personal memory site: astrophotography on one side, philosophy/science/politics/personal notes and observations on the other.
Built with Astro as a fully static site. Sleek, minimalist, dark aesthetic. 

---

## Site Architecture

Two top-level sections, clearly separated in navigation and visual identity:

| Section | Slug | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Astro** | `/astro` | Astrophotography — backyard astrophotgraphy blog |
| **Shards** | `/shards` | Thoughts on philosophy, science, and politics, personal notes, travel blogs — essays and image galleries |

Each section has:
- A **blog** (long-form or short text posts)
- A **gallery** (collections of images with captions and short description)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Astro (static output, `output: 'static'`)
- **Styling**: CSS custom properties (design tokens) + scoped component styles; no utility-class framework
- **Content**: Astro Content Collections (Markdown/MDX for posts, JSON/YAML for gallery metadata)
- **Images**: Astro's built-in `<Image />` component for optimisation
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (TBD — likely Cloudflare Pages or Netlify)
- **No client-side JS** unless strictly necessary

---

## Design System

### Palette

| Token | Value | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| `--color-bg` | `#111318` | Page background |
| `--color-surface` | `#1a1d24` | Cards, panels |
| `--color-border` | `#2a2d36` | Dividers, outlines |
| `--color-text` | `#e2e4ea` | Body text |
| `--color-text-muted` | `#7a7f92` | Captions, metadata |
| `--color-accent-astro` | `#5dd6c8` | Astro section accent (mint teal — sky / water) |
| `--color-accent-shards` | `#e8a87c` | Shards section accent (warm peach — earth / sun) |

> Tweak hex values here and update throughout — these are the source of truth.

### Typography

Font choice follows a **two-font combo** strategy per section, plus a pinned wordmark and a pinned mono. Start with the **anchor headline font** — it sets the whole personality of the section. Find a body/UI font that contrasts with the anchor without clashing; they should feel like they come from the same world but offer visual variety.

- **`--font-brand`** — pinned wordmark for the `apeia.eu` link in the header. Stays the same across both sections so the brand has a consistent face. Currently *Bricolage Grotesque*.
- **Astro anchor** — geometric, precise, instrument-panel feel. *Outfit* (display) + *DM Sans* (body/UI).
- **Shards anchor** — literary, human, warmer. *Newsreader* (display, with optical sizing) + *Lora* (body).
- **`--font-mono`** — pinned for image captions, dates, tag pills, eyebrows, code. Currently *JetBrains Mono*. Don't flip it per section; it's the connective tissue between rooms.
- **Scale**: Fluid type via `clamp()` — define in `src/styles/tokens.css`.
- **Line length**: Cap prose at `65ch`.
- All fonts are loaded from Google Fonts at the top of `src/styles/tokens.css`. No system-font fallback as a final design — system stacks remain only for graceful loading degradation.

### Star of the Show

Each section's landing experience must have **one element that makes a visitor feel something** before they read a word. It is not chosen for aesthetics — it grows directly from the section's content identity.

- **Astro**: The hero *photograph* is the star. One dramatic full-bleed image commands the hero; every layout decision serves it.
- **Shards**: More typographic — a bold headline or a provocative pull quote anchors the hero, supported by a subtle abstract visual.
- **Home (`/`)**: A full-bleed photograph behind the whole page, randomly selected per load from images tagged `home-page`. See the [Home Page Background](#home-page-background) section.

The star is the visual seed. Every other decorative choice on the page grows from it. If a decoration has no connection to the star, cut it.

### Visual Rhyming

Repeat a small set of visual details throughout the section so everything feels from the same universe. Derive 1–2 motifs from the star of the show and echo them across UI chrome:

- **Astro motif** — circular/orbital forms echoing celestial bodies (rings, arcs, dot grids)
- **Shards motif** — angular, faceted shapes echoing the section name (diagonals, shard edges, crystalline cuts)

Apply motifs subtly to: dividers, tag pill shapes, icon choices, section breaks, image masks. Accent colour appearing consistently in interactive states (tag pills, hover, active indicators) also counts as rhyming.

### Depth

The site should feel tangible, not flat:

- Add subtle **noise/grain texture** to hero backgrounds and large image overlays — not to cards or UI chrome.
- Cards and panels may use a light **glass/frost effect** (`backdrop-filter: blur` + low-opacity surface colour) — keep it barely-there.
- Depth cues must never compete with the star of the show. If in doubt, pull back.
- Gradients and shadows **are allowed** where they serve depth, not decoration — keep them low-contrast and monochromatic.

### Text Opacity Hierarchy

Do not set all text to 100% opacity. Use opacity to signal read-priority:

| Level | Opacity | Use |
|---|---|---|
| High emphasis | 100% | Headlines, primary CTAs |
| Body | 87% | Main body text |
| Medium | 70% | Subheadings, supporting copy |
| Muted | `--color-text-muted` colour | Captions, timestamps, metadata |

### General Principles

- Whitespace over decoration
- Images lead; text supports
- Transitions: `150ms ease` max
- **Iterate aggressively**: before committing to a layout or star of the show, try at least 2–3 completely different directions — different layout, different star, different font combo. The first version is a draft, not a destination.

## Content Collections

Define in `src/content/config.ts`.

### `astro-posts`
```
src/content/astro/posts/
  YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```
Frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `summary`, `tags[]`, `draft`

### `astro-gallery`
```
src/content/astro/gallery/
  collection-slug/
    meta.yaml       # title, date, description, tags[], object{?}
    *.jpg / *.webp
```
Individual images within a gallery can carry their own tags via an `images` list in `meta.yaml` (see Tagging section).

Astro galleries also accept an optional **`object:`** block describing the astronomical subject. Every field is itself optional — pick whatever the night and the source data justified, leave the rest off. The card only renders the fields that are present, and is hidden entirely if the whole block is absent.

```yaml
object:
  constellation: "Orion"
  position:      "RA 5h 35m 17s · Dec −5° 23′"
  culmination:   "Late January"
  distance:      "≈ 1,344 ly"
  size:          "≈ 24 ly across"
  apparentSize:  "65′ × 60′"
```

Values are free-form strings so authors can write whatever notation reads best (HMS/DMS, decimal degrees, "≈", arc-min vs arc-sec, etc.). The `Shards` gallery schema does not accept this block.

### `shards-posts`
```
src/content/shards/posts/
  YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```
Frontmatter: `title`, `date`, `summary`, `tags[]`, `topic` (philosophy | science | politics | personal | travel), `draft`

### `shards-gallery`
```
src/content/shards/gallery/
  collection-slug/
    meta.yaml       # title, date, description, tags[]
    *.jpg / *.webp
```

## Page Routes

| Route | File |
|---|---|
| `/` | `src/pages/index.astro` — landing, links to both sections |
| `/astro` | Section index: recent posts + gallery previews |
| `/astro/blog` | Post list |
| `/astro/blog/[slug]` | Single post |
| `/astro/gallery` | Gallery index |
| `/astro/gallery/[slug]` | Single gallery |
| `/astro/gallery/[slug]/[image]` | Per-image **permalink** page (one per image in the gallery) |
| `/astro/gallery/[slug]/[image]/[file]` | Per-image **variant download** endpoint (serves the actual bytes) |
| `/astro/tags` | Tag browser for Astro section |
| `/astro/tags/[tag]` | All Astro artefacts (posts + galleries + images) with that tag |
| `/shards` | Section index |
| `/shards/blog` | Post list |
| `/shards/blog/[slug]` | Single post |
| `/shards/gallery` | Gallery index |
| `/shards/gallery/[slug]` | Single gallery |
| `/shards/gallery/[slug]/[image]` | Per-image **permalink** page |
| `/shards/gallery/[slug]/[image]/[file]` | Per-image **variant download** endpoint |
| `/shards/tags` | Tag browser for Shards section |
| `/shards/tags/[tag]` | All Shards artefacts (posts + galleries + images) with that tag |

---

## Component Conventions

- One component per file in `src/components/`
- Shared layout shell: `src/layouts/Base.astro`
- Section-aware layout: `src/layouts/SectionLayout.astro` (accepts `section: 'astro' | 'shards'` prop → sets accent CSS variable)
- No default exports from `.ts` utility files; named exports only

---

## Tagging

Tags are first-class content — every post, gallery, and individual image is taggable with multiple free-form strings. Each section has its own isolated tag namespace and its own visual tag browser.

### Where tags live

**Blog posts** — in frontmatter:
```yaml
tags: [nebula, widefield, Ha, summer-2024]
```

**Gallery collections** — in `meta.yaml`, two levels:
```yaml
title: Orion Rising
date: 2025-01-12
description: Three-panel mosaic of Orion from the backyard.
tags: [mosaic, orion, winter]          # gallery-level tags
images:
  - file: orion-panel-1.jpg
    caption: Left panel — Barnard's Loop
    tags: [barnards-loop, emission]
  - file: orion-panel-2.jpg
    caption: Centre — Trapezium core
    tags: [trapezium, open-cluster]
  - file: orion-panel-3.jpg
    caption: Right panel — M78
    tags: [reflection-nebula, m78]
```
Gallery-level tags are inherited by every image in the collection unless overridden. Image-level tags are *additive* (union, not replacement).

### Tag browser pages

Each section exposes two statically-generated routes:

- `/astro/tags` — the **Astro tag browser**
- `/shards/tags` — the **Shards tag browser**

These are generated at build time from all tags collected across posts, galleries, and images in that section.

### Tag browser design

The tag browser (`src/components/TagBrowser.astro`) renders a scrollable grid of tag pills. Each pill shows the tag name and a count of matching artefacts. Pills use the section's accent colour. Clicking a pill navigates to the tag result page.

```
[ nebula ×14 ]  [ mosaic ×6 ]  [ Ha ×9 ]  [ widefield ×11 ]  ...
```

Visual rules:
- Pills are inline-flex, `border: 1px solid --color-border`, accent-coloured text, `padding: 0.25em 0.75em`
- On hover: background shifts to `--color-surface`, accent border
- No tag cloud font-size scaling — uniform size, sorted by count descending by default; secondary sort A–Z
- No JS required — the browser is a static page of `<a>` links

### Tag result pages

`/astro/tags/[tag]` and `/shards/tags/[tag]` are generated via `getStaticPaths()` at build time.

Each result page shows all matching artefacts grouped by type and sorted by date descending:

1. **Posts** — list of post cards (title, date, summary excerpt)
2. **Galleries** — list of gallery cards (cover image, title, date)
3. **Images** — grid of individual images with their parent gallery linked in caption

If a section has zero results for a given type, that group is omitted entirely. Empty-state copy if no artefacts at all: *"Nothing tagged [tag] yet."*

### Implementation notes

- Tag collection happens in a shared utility `src/lib/tags.ts`:
  - `getTagsForSection(section: 'astro' | 'shards')` → `Map<string, TagEntry[]>` where `TagEntry` is `{ type: 'post' | 'gallery' | 'image', slug, title, date, href, thumbnail? }`
  - Called once at build time; passed as props to browser and result pages
- Tags are normalised on ingest: lowercased, spaces → hyphens
- Tags are **not** shared between sections — `/astro/tags/nebula` and `/shards/tags/nebula` are independent pages
- `TagBrowser.astro` and `TagResultList.astro` are shared components; section identity comes from the `section` prop

---

## Home Page Background

The landing page (`/`) carries a **full-bleed photograph behind everything**, randomly selected on each page load from the pool of images tagged `home-page` across both gallery sections. This is the home equivalent of a section's "star of the show": the image speaks first, the text supports.

### How an image qualifies

Tag any image — or a whole gallery — with `home-page` to add it to the rotation:

```yaml
images:
  - file: ./M31 - Andromeda Galaxy.jpg
    tags: [4k, wallpaper, home-page]
```

Matching follows the additive rule used everywhere else: gallery-level `home-page` qualifies every image in that gallery; image-level `home-page` qualifies only that one.

The pool is collected at build time by `src/lib/homeBackgrounds.ts`, which runs every candidate through Astro's `getImage()` (webp, 2400 px wide) and emits the optimised URL list to the page.

### Selection and presentation

- **Random per page load** — a tiny inline script in `src/pages/index.astro` picks one URL with `Math.random()` from the embedded list. Asset caching is fine; the freshness is in the pick, not the file.
- **Aspect ratio preserved** — `background-size: cover; background-position: center`. The image fills the viewport; edges may crop. Switching to `contain` (full image visible, possible empty bands) is a one-line change.
- **Fade-in** — `.page-bg` starts at opacity 0; a `new Image()` preloads the URL, then we add `.is-loaded` and fade to 1 over 600 ms. Prevents a flash before the asset arrives. If preload fails the deep-bg colour stays in place.
- **Legibility over the photo, not by darkening it** — the veil (`.page-bg-veil`) is mostly clear at the top of the viewport (let the image breathe) and ramps darker only at the bottom where content needs a readable floor. The hero headline carries a soft `text-shadow` so it stays readable over a bright patch of sky without us having to dim the whole image.
- **Frosted home cards** — the two section cards on the landing use `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)` plus a 62 %-opacity surface tint, so they remain readable over any random photo without competing with it.

### Client-side JS exception

This feature is the **only** place on the site that ships JavaScript to the browser. The Tech Stack rule ("no client-side JS unless strictly necessary") permits exactly this case: per-load randomness on a static site cannot be achieved server-side. The script is inline (no extra request), runs once on `DOMContentLoaded`, and degrades silently if anything goes wrong.

### Tuning the veil

`.page-bg-veil` in `src/pages/index.astro` is a single linear gradient. Approximate stops:

```
0–35 %  → 10 % black overlay   (image breathes)
80 %    → 55 % black overlay   (transition into content)
100 %   → 85 % black overlay   (dark floor under recent-posts)
```

If photographs still feel too dark, lower these alphas; if text legibility at the bottom suffers, raise the `100 %` stop.

## Image Permalinks

Every gallery image has a **stable URL space** that doesn't move across rebuilds. This is the canonical address for the image — visitors can bookmark, share, or link to these URLs and the links survive future changes to the image pipeline (quality bumps, format switches, Astro/Vite upgrades). See the "Stability" subsection below for what does and doesn't preserve them.

### URL scheme

For each image in each gallery, three layers of URL exist:

```
/{section}/gallery/{gallery-slug}/{image-slug}/                                — per-image page
/{section}/gallery/{gallery-slug}/{image-slug}/{image-slug}-{variant}.{ext}    — variant download
```

- **`section`** — `astro` or `shards`.
- **`gallery-slug`** — directory name under `src/content/{section}-gallery/`.
- **`image-slug`** — derived from the original filename: extension stripped, lowercased, non-alphanumeric runs collapsed to `-`. `M104 - Sombrero.jpg` → `m104-sombrero`.
- **`variant`** — one of `original | 800 | 2k | 4k`.
- **`ext`** — extension of the source file (`jpg`, `png`, `webp`, …).

Concrete example for `src/content/astro-gallery/m104-sombrero/M104.jpg` (4096 × 2731):

- Per-image page: `/astro/gallery/m104-sombrero/m104/`
- Original download: `/astro/gallery/m104-sombrero/m104/m104-original.jpg`
- 4K download: `/astro/gallery/m104-sombrero/m104/m104-4k.jpg`
- 2K download: `/astro/gallery/m104-sombrero/m104/m104-2k.jpg`
- 800-px download: `/astro/gallery/m104-sombrero/m104/m104-800.jpg`

### Variants offered

Same rule as before — never offer a resolution larger than the source:

- **Original** — the source file, byte-for-byte.
- **4K · 3840 px** — only when source > 3840 wide.
- **2K · 2048 px** — only when source > 2048 wide.
- **800 px** — only when source > 800 wide.

A 600-px source thus offers only Original. A 1500-px source offers Original + 800. Only 4K-or-bigger sources show every option.

### How it's wired

The single source of truth is **`src/lib/imagePermalinks.ts`**. At module load it walks every `meta.yaml` via `import.meta.glob('/src/content/*-gallery/*/meta.yaml', { query: '?raw' })`, builds a registry of `{section, gallerySlug, imageIndex, imageSlug, originalFilename, fsPath}` per image, and exposes helpers (`pageUrl`, `variantUrl`, `variantDownloadName`, `variantsForWidth`, `resolveFileRequest`, …).

Two route files per section serve the URLs:

- **`src/pages/{section}/gallery/[slug]/[image]/index.astro`** — the per-image page. Renders the photo via Astro's `<Image>` (so the in-page display still benefits from `/_astro/`-hashed cache-busting), plus caption, notes, tags, and the list of downloads.
- **`src/pages/{section}/gallery/[slug]/[image]/[file].ts`** — a static endpoint that produces the actual bytes at the permalink URL. For `original` it copies the source file verbatim; for `800/2k/4k` it runs sharp at quality 95 in the source format. Astro writes the response body to a real file at the URL path, so visitors get a clean direct download with no redirect.

`src/lib/galleryDownloads.ts` is a thin shim that produces the `DownloadOption[]` consumed by `GalleryLayout.astro` — it just asks the permalink registry for URLs.

### UI

Each gallery image in `GalleryLayout.astro` has a three-pill action strip in its top-right corner:

- **Fullscreen** — pure-CSS `:target` overlay (same as before).
- **Share** — links to the per-image permalink page. The icon is the iOS-style "box with arrow up". Same pill family as Fullscreen.
- **Download** — a pure-HTML `<details>`/`<summary>` dropdown listing the available variants. Each menu item is an `<a>` with `download="<friendly-name>"`. Clicking a row navigates to the permalink, which serves the file bytes directly — `download` works as expected.

The Download dropdown picks up the section motif (rounded for Astro, shard-cut for Shards). On viewports under 640 px the pills collapse to icons-only.

The dropdown ships no JavaScript — `<details>` handles open/close. Clicking the summary again closes it. Clicking outside doesn't auto-close.

### Stability

What's permanent:

- **Page routes and gallery slugs** are stable as long as you don't rename the file (for posts) or directory (for galleries).
- **Image slugs** are stable as long as you don't rename the original file. If you rename `M104.jpg` to `M104_v2.jpg`, the slug changes from `m104` to `m104-v2`.
- **Variant URLs** are stable as long as both `gallerySlug` and `originalFilename` stay the same. They are immune to image-encoding parameter changes (quality, format), Astro/Vite version upgrades, and bundler heuristic shifts.

What's *not* permanent (and is invalidated when it changes):

- `/_astro/`-hashed URLs used for in-page **display** images. These deliberately rotate when the file content or transformation parameters change, so the browser cache flushes correctly. They're not what the permalink mechanism is for.
- Anchor fragments inside a gallery page (`#img-1`, `#fs-1`) — these are positional, so reordering `images:` in `meta.yaml` will shift them.

### Adding a new variant size

Edit the variant tables at the top of `src/lib/imagePermalinks.ts`:

```ts
const VARIANT_WIDTHS: Record<Variant, number | null> = {
  original: null,
  '800': 800,
  '2k': 2048,
  '4k': 3840,
};
```

Add a new entry (and a matching label/short in the parallel maps), include it in `ALL_VARIANTS`, and add it to the `Variant` union type. Rebuild. The "skip if width >= source width" rule applies automatically, and the new endpoint URLs appear in the Download menu and the per-image page.

## Open Decisions

- [x] Exact section names — **Astro** (`/astro`) and **Shards** (`/shards`) confirmed
- [x] Accent colour values — **Astro `#5dd6c8` (mint teal)**, **Shards `#e8a87c` (warm peach)**
- [x] Astro font combo — **Outfit** (display) + **DM Sans** (body)
- [x] Shards font combo — **Newsreader** (display, opsz) + **Lora** (body)
- [x] Brand wordmark — **Bricolage Grotesque** pinned across both sections via `--font-brand`
- [ ] Astro star of the show — confirm hero image treatment and orbital/circular motif
- [ ] Shards star of the show — confirm typographic anchor and shard/angular motif
- [ ] Depth level — decide how far to push noise texture and glass effects (subtle vs. very subtle)
- [ ] Deployment target
